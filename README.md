# RLC Example

In this example of an RLC circuit, the time-domain transient response data are generated by a step change in the source voltage with the capacitor voltage measured at a sampling period of 0.001 s. A white noise is imposed. The data are used to identify the input/output model: from the source voltage to the capacitor voltage. Furthermore, the parameters of R, L, C will be mapped from the transfer function coefficients. In addition, we assume to have 30 points of frequency response data available. Using frequency-domain data fitting, we may find the transfer function. We also resort to the PEM method and show how to directly find the RLC circuit parameters. The codes of this tutorial example are available at https://github.com/fllseu/RLCExample.
